#Topple

This is a small app built off of a talk I saw where the presenter mentioned he pulled many gifs off of tumblr.  I wanted a system to pull down a random image from tumblr using a tag or blog.  The code is still a work in progress. 

To run simply pull down the code, copy application.properties.example into an actual application.properties and add your credentials.

Then simply execute:

	./gradlew clean run
